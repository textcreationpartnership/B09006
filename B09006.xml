            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have called you together upon a very extraordinary Occaſion; but extraordinary Diſeaſes muſt have extraordinary Remedies. The Malicious Endeavours of my Enemies have ſo poiſoned the Minds of ſome of my Subjects, that by the Reports I have from all Hands, I have Reaſon to believe, That very many do not think this Son with which God hath bleſſed Me, to be Mine, but a Suppoſed Child. But I may ſay, that by particular Providence, ſcarce any Prince was ever Born where there were ſo many Perſons preſent.</p>
               <p>I have taken this time to have the Matter Heard and Examined here, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the firſt Eaſtwardly Wind, will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this Kingdom: And as I have often ventured My Life for the Nation before I came to the Crown, ſo I think My Self more obliged to do the ſame, now I am KING; and do intend to go in Perſon againſt him, whereby I may be expoſed to Accidents, and therefore I thought it neceſſary to have this now done, in order to ſatisfie the minds of My Subjects, and to prevent this Kingdom's being engaged in Blood and Confuſion after my Death, deſiring to do always what may contribute moſt to the Eaſe and Quiet of my Subjects, which I have ſhewed by Securing to them their Liberty of Conſcience, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their Properties, which I will always preſerve.</p>
               <p>I have deſired the Queen Dowager to give Her Self the trouble to come hither, to Declare what ſhe knows of the Birth of My Son, and moſt of the Ladies, Lords, and other Perſons who were preſent, are ready here to Depoſe upon Oath their Knowledge of this Matter.</p>

The Day following the Queen Dowager ſent this Deponent to ſee how the Queen did; who replied, She had a pretty good Night, and did think ſhe had Quickned, but would not be poſitive till ſhe felt it again; That after this the Deponent did frequently wait on the Queen in the Morning, and did ſee her Shift her ſeveral Days, and generally ſaw the Milk, and ſometimes Wet upon her Smock.

As ſoon as the Deponent came in, her Majeſty told her, this Deponent, She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſhe was in Labour. By this time the Bed was warmed, and the Queen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:184546:3"/>went into Bed, and the King came in. The Queen asked the King, if he had ſent for the Queen Dowager; He ſaid he had ſent for every Body.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome lingring Pains, the Queen ſaid, ſhe feared ſhe ſhould not be brought to Bed a good while; but enquiring of the Midwife, ſhe aſſured her Majeſty, that ſhe wanted only one thorow Pain to bring the Child into the World; Upon which the Queen ſaid, It is impoſſible, the Child lies ſo high, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this Deponent to lay her Hand on her Majeſties Belly, to feel how high the Child lay, which the Deponent did; but ſoon after a great Pain came on at paſt Nine of the Clock, and the Queen was Delivered; which the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by pulling the Deponent by the Coat, aſſured her was a Son, it being the Sign ſhe told the Deponent ſhe would give her, the Queen having charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her not to let her Majeſty know preſently, whether it was Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As ſoon as the Midwife had given the Deponent the Sign, the Deponent made a Sign to to the King that it was a Son. When the Midwife had done her Office, ſhe gave the Child to Mrs. <hi>Delabadie,</hi> which was a Son, and ſhe carried it into the little Bed-Chamber.</p>

And while the Queen was with Child, this Deponent hath heard her Majeſty command her Midwife not to do otherwiſe, it being counted much the ſafeſt way; But to what the Queen ſaid juſt then (to the beſt of this Deponents Remembrance) Mrs. <hi>Wilks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, Pray Madam give me leave, for I will do nothing, but what will be ſafe for Your Self and Child; The Queen Anſwered, Do then, and then cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where is the King gone; His Majeſty came immediatly from the other ſide of the Bed (from juſt having a ſight of the Child) and anſwered the Queen,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:184546:3"/>Here I am; the Queen ſaid, Why do ye leave me now? The King kneeled on the Bed, on that ſide where the Deponent ſtood, and a little after the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife ſaid, All is now come ſafe away; Upon that the King roſe from the Bed, and ſaid, Pray, my Lords, come and ſee the Child: The king followed Mrs. <hi>Labadie,</hi> and the Lords His Majeſty, into the Little Bed-chamber, where this Deponent followed alſo, and ſaw as well as they, that it was a Prince, and that Mrs. <hi>Wilks</hi> was in the right to deſire to part the Child, for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces face eſpecially his Forehead was blackiſh, being ſtunn'd, as I have ſeen ſome other Children, when they have been juſt newly come into the World; but God be thanked, in two hours time that he was dreſt and waſht, (which the Deponent ſtaid by and ſaw done) the Prince lookt very freſh and well.

Then paſſing to the Queen in the next Bed-chamber, the Deponent congratulated the happy Birth of the Prince, and her Majeſties ſafe Delivery. The Queen was wearied and panting, but otherwiſe in good condition: Then the Midwife brought to the Deponent the <hi>After-Birth</hi> reeking warm, which Sir <hi>Thomas Witherley</hi> with the Deponent examined, and found very ſound and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. After a while, the Deponent underſtood that a Medicine was mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Ladies for a certain Remedy againſt Convulſions: It was, ſome drops of blood from the Navel-ſtring; the Deponent conſulted Sir <hi>Thomas Witherley</hi> and the other Phyſitians; and to ſatisfie the Women, it was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; there being, as was conceived, no danger in the thing. Whereupon, the Midwife, with a ſmall Knife ſlit the Navel-ſtring beyond the Ligature, from which came ſome drops of freſh blood, taken in a Spoon, and given the Child, being mix'd with a little <hi>Black-Cherry-Water.</hi> Thus much the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hath to ſay upon Her Majeſties preſent delivery.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Time of the Queens Conception, She often told the Deponent and others, That She had two Reckonings; one, from <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 6th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> when the King return'd from His Progreſs to the Queen then at <hi>Bathe;</hi> and the other, from <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 6th of <hi>October,</hi> when the Queen came to the King at <hi>Windſor;</hi> but for ſome Reaſons the Queen rather reckoned from the latter; though afterward it proved juſt to agree with the former. Moreover, Her Majeſty, when, according to Her Reckoning, She was gone with Child Twelve Weeks, ſaid, That She was quick, and perceived the Child to move; the Deponent returned no Anſwer to the Queen, but privately told thoſe about Her, That in truth it could not ſo be in ſo ſhort a Time, Yet the Queen was in the right, only miſtook Her Reckoning; for She was then full ſixteen Weeks gone with Child; about which time She uſually quickned with Her former Children, and accordingly was brought to Bed on the 10th of <hi>June</hi> 1688. and within Three or Four days of full Forty Weeks.</p>

I went to St. <hi>James</hi>'s Houſe about Nine a Clock in the Morning, and followed my Lord Chancellor, through the Lodgings to the Dreſſing Room, next to the Queens Bed-Chamber, where divers Lords of the Council were met, upon occaſion of the Queens being in Labour, the King came ſeveral times into the Room, and amongſt other things was pleaſed to tell us, that the Queen came exactly according to her firſt Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, which was from the Kings Return from his Progreſs, to <hi>Bathe</hi> in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1687. After this the Counſellors were ordered to come into the Bed-Chamber, and I ſtood on that ſide of the Bed, that had the Curtains drawn open, I heard Her Majeſty Cry outſeveral times. I ſtaid in the Room during

                           <p>I Had the Honor to be in the King's Chamber in the Morning, when word was brought him, the Queen was not well, and followed him into the Dreſſing Room next her Majeſties Bed-Chamber, where I ſtaid till His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty called me to come in, which was about the beginning of her Pains. I confeſs the Compaſſion I had for Her Majeſty, hearing her Crys, made my ſtay there very uneaſie; One of the laſt eſpecially ſeemed to me ſo ſharp, as it really forced me for a little time to ſtop my Ears with my Fingers to avoid hearing more of the like; when ſetting them at Liberty, I heard no more, but perceived a ſuddenſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Faces of the Aſſiſtance, ſeveral ſaying, that the Queen was Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and ſoon thereupon I ſaw the Prince brought from about the Bed, and carried into the little Bed-Chamber, whither I went afterwards, to behold him more particularly, where I ſaw him as a Child newly Born.</p>
